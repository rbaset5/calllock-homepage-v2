You're the only one available. ‚ö° Speed kills competition: While their voicemail plays, your text is already asking \"What's the emergency?\" üîß No bandwidth tax: You don't check an app. You don't monitor anything.

Price shoppers filtered out: \"Just need a quote for future project\" = flagged as 20% conversion, bottom of callback list. Saves you 30 min of phone tag. Route planning built-in: Address + service area validation means you never waste gas on \"oh sorry, I'm actually in Worcester\" calls. Priority ranking: When you have 12 missed calls, you see the $8K emergency first, the $400 estimate last. Call back in order of revenue, not chronology. Timing intel: \"Tomorrow afternoon works\" means 80% higher first-call booking rate than going in blind. Multi-service capture: Customer needs \"furnace repair + water heater quote\" ‚Üí you arrive prepared, upsell on-site, close both jobs."
